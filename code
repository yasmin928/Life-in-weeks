#Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

#It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

#You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

#Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
age_int =int(age)
years =90-age_int
days = years*365
weeks = years*52
month = years*12

reasult = f"you have {days} days, {weeks} weeks ,and {month} months left."

print(reasult)
